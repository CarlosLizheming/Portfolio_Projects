# Portfolio_Projects
Hare are all Portfolio Projects that I have completed in SGUS Associate Data Analyst Course from NTUC LearningHub. 
This is a full-time 9-month training program initiated by Singapore Government to upskill and reskill mid-career individuals and boost their employability to take on a new career.
Throughout this course, I have acquired many industry-relevant skills and completed several capstone projects leveraging these skills to demonstrate my capabilities and competency to a data analytics job.
## Project 1:

Topic: **FIFA WorldCup Performance Analysis (1930-2014)**
