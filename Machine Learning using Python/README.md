### Portfolio Project
# Machine Learning using Python
## Topic: Identifying the Terrorist Organization responsible for a Terrorist Attack

The **purpose** of this project is to demonstrate my capability and competency in **Machine Learning** using **Python** Language.

The goal of this project is to exhibit five stages of the data lifecycle through the use of following Machine Learning **Algorithms**:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
3. **Decision Trees & Random Forest**
4. **Naive Bayes**<br>

A best performance **Machine Learning Model** will be selected as an end result after comparison among fine-tuned models to solve this **Classification** problem.
